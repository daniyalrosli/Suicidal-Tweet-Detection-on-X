    <h1>Welcome to Suicidal Tweet Detection</h1>
    <p>We are committed to providing a tool that can assist in the early detection of potentially suicidal tweets. By
        leveraging the power of <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>natural language processing
            (NLP)</strong>, this project aims to offer a valuable resource for mental health professionals, researchers,
        and individuals concerned about online safety.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>The rise of social media has brought both positive and negative effects on mental health. With millions of tweets
        shared daily, it is crucial to identify potentially harmful content early. Our goal is to develop a reliable
        detection system that can help in preventing suicide by flagging tweets that may indicate suicidal thoughts.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Using advanced machine learning algorithms and NLP, we analyze tweet content to determine if it contains
        indicators of suicidal ideation. This system is not intended to replace professional intervention, but rather to
        aid in the detection process and alert the need for support.</p>

    <h2>Get Started</h2>
    <p>If you're ready to try our tool, head over to the <a href="{{ url_for('tweet_detection') }}">Tweet Detection</a>
        section. Enter a tweet and our system will predict whether it may contain suicidal content.</p>
