This project aims to build a machine-learning model to detect suicidal ideation and related distress in tweets posted on X (previously known as Twitter). With the increasing use of social media platforms for expressing emotions, detecting suicidal content has become crucial in identifying individuals at risk and providing timely intervention.

The project implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based classification model to analyze tweet texts and categorize them as either “Suicidal” or “Non-Suicidal.” Additionally, it performs sentiment analysis to evaluate the emotional tone of the tweets further, providing insights into the level of distress by classifying tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. This dual-layered approach not only helps in detecting suicidal tendencies but also assists in understanding the underlying emotional states of users.

Key features of the project include:

- Preprocessing of tweet texts to clean and normalize the data.
- Feature extraction using popular NLP techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).
- Training a machine-learning model for suicidal ideation detection.
- Sentiment analysis to categorize the emotional tone of tweets.
- Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

This repository contains the code and resources for implementing both the suicidal tweet detection and sentiment analysis tasks, aimed at enhancing mental health support and timely interventions on social media.
